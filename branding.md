# Branding Guidelines

This is the guidelines for using our branding, whether it is the corporate's branding, or our software branding.

## Copyright Ownership Notice
Keep in mind that all the branding that we created remains our content and any illegal usage will be handled as *Copyright infringement*.

## Fair use
This secton will outline the scenarios where usage of the branding is acceptable; however, usage of our corporate branding is acceptable as long as it falls under **fair use**.

However the **acceptable usage** for Plethan Software *("Software")* is the following:
* Representing the (original) Software project.
  1. For example, you may use the the Software logo on-screen in a tutorial video when you're referring to the Software project...
  2. ...as an image in a news article or blog post where you are talking about the Software project...
  3. ...as an icon in a data visualisation to represent the Software project...
  4. ...or in general, any use where it's very clear you're referring to the Software project. This does not extend to derived or inspired-by projects.
 
If your usage isn't listed here, you **must** get an explict permission from Sinlernick himself.
